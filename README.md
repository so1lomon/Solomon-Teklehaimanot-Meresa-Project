# Solomon-Teklehaimanot-Meresa-Project
This project examines the Genetic Algorithmâ€“based PID, PI, and PD control responses of a series field DC motor under measurement noise.

Key points of the project:

The series field DC motor is nonlinear. Its transfer function was obtained by linearizing the model around 400 rad/s using a Taylor series expansion.

A Genetic Algorithm was used to determine the optimal values of kp, ki, and kd.

In the fitness function, measurement noise in the form of white Gaussian noise was incorporated. This noise was added to the output motor speed, and the controller gains were optimized under these noisy conditions.
