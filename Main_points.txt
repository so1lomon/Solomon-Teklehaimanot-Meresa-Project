This project examines the PID, PI, and PD control responses of a series field DC motor under measurement noise.

Key points of the project:

The series field DC motor is nonlinear. I obtained its transfer function by linearizing the model around 400 rad/s using a Taylor series expansion.

I used a Genetic Algorithm to determine the optimal values of kp, ki, and kd.

In the fitness function, I incorporated measurement noise in the form of white Gaussian noise. This noise was added to the output motor speed, and the controller gains were optimized under these noisy conditions.
